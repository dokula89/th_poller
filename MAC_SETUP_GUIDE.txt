## Profile Settings

Queue Poller automatically detects Mac and uses the "OSx" profile with:
- SF Pro Text font (Mac system font)
- Slower automation timing for Mac compatibility
- Correct paths for Tesseract and other tools

You can switch profiles in the app using the Profile dropdown below the Metro selector.
